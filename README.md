## ⚡ Performance Optimization

The dashboard is designed to handle large-scale data efficiently:

### **Scalability Limits**
- **Projects**: Handles 1000+ projects with virtual scrolling
- **Time Blocks**: Manages 10,000+ time blocks with pagination
- **Dashboard**: Displays 5 recent projects, 20 time blocks
- **Weekly Reports**: Shows top 10 projects, max 500 time blocks

### **Optimization Techniques**
- **Database Queries**: Limited and indexed queries with chunking
- **Component Rendering**: Memoized components with React.memo
- **List Virtualization**: Only renders visible items in large lists
- **Search Debouncing**: 300ms delay prevents excessive filtering
- **Lazy Loading**: Progressive data loading with infinite scroll
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup and garbage collection

### **Performance Monitoring**
```javascript
// Built-in performance monitoring
import { performanceMonitor } from './utils/performance';

// Track component render time
const timing = performanceMonitor.timing('ComponentName');
// ... component logic
timing(); // Logs if over threshold

// Monitor database operations
const dbOp = performanceMonitor.monitor('queryProjects', queryFunction);
```
